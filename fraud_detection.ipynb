Training a model on such imbalanced data can lead to a model that performs well on the majority class (non-fraud) but poorly on the minority class (fraud), which is the class of interest. To address this, `SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)` will be used to generate synthetic samples for the minority class, helping to balance the dataset.

        "### Q&A\n",
        "The threshold adjustment to 0.9850 significantly impacted the model's precision and recall for the fraud class. Specifically, the precision for detecting fraud increased to 0.50, meaning that 50% of transactions flagged as fraud are indeed fraudulent. This was achieved while maintaining a high recall of 0.83, indicating that the model still successfully identifies 83% of actual fraudulent cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "For fraud detection, this adjustment implies a more efficient allocation of resources. By increasing precision, the model generates fewer false positives, reducing the number of legitimate transactions that need to be reviewed or investigated. This minimizes operational costs associated with false alarms and improves customer experience by avoiding unnecessary friction. Simultaneously, maintaining a high recall ensures that a substantial majority of actual fraudulent activities are still caught, mitigating potential financial losses from undetected fraud. The chosen threshold represents a balanced approach, prioritizing the reduction of false positives without severely compromising the ability to detect true fraud.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   An optimal classification threshold of 0.9850 was identified by iterating through the Precision-Recall curve to achieve a desired precision target of 0.5 for the fraud class.\n",
        "*   Applying this optimal threshold resulted in a precision of 0.50 for the fraud class (Class 1). This means that 50% of all predicted fraud cases are true positives.\n",
        "*   At this selected threshold, the model maintained a recall of 0.83 for the fraud class, indicating that 83% of all actual fraudulent transactions were correctly identified.\n",
        "*   The F1-score for the fraud class with the new threshold was 0.62, reflecting the combined performance of precision and recall.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The chosen threshold of 0.9850 effectively balances the trade-off between precision and recall, significantly reducing false positives (improving precision) while retaining a strong ability to detect actual fraud (high recall). This balance is highly beneficial for operational efficiency in fraud detection.\n",
        "*   Future work could involve quantifying the financial costs associated with false positives and false negatives to establish an even more economically optimal threshold, or by performing an A/B test with the new threshold to evaluate its real-world impact.\n"
